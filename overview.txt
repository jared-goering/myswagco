	•	XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL, etc.
	•	Live total quantity:

3. Internal Workflow & Statuses

Order Status Lifecycle (internal)
	1.	New – Deposit Paid
	•	Customer finished checkout.
	•	Status auto-set to “Pending Art Review.”
	2.	Pending Art Review
	•	Team checks:
	•	Is artwork high enough resolution?
	•	Number of colors matches what they selected?
	•	Any production issues (tiny text, gradients, etc.)?
	3.	Art Approved (Auto-Approved Flow)

	•	If artwork is acceptable:
	•	Mark order as Art Approved / In Production.
	•	Start 14-business-day clock toward estimated ship date.
	•	Optional: send automated email:
“Your artwork is approved! We’ve moved your order into production. We’re targeting shipment around [Date].”

	4.	Issues Found

	•	If artwork cannot be used as-is:
	•	Internal status: “Art Revision Needed.”
	•	Manual email to customer describing:
	•	Required changes, or
	•	New price if color count/location needs adjustment.
	•	Admin can adjust price → send invoice link for difference if needed.

	5.	Ready to Ship / Balance Due

	•	Before shipping, ensure remaining 50% is collected:
	•	Second payment via invoice or Shopify payment request.
	•	When fully paid, change status to “Ready to Ship / Completed.”

4. Pricing & Quoting Engine (Screen Print Only)

Key Inputs
	•	Garment:
	•	Base cost per shirt (your cost).
	•	Pricing tiers (quantity ranges → margin/markup rules).
	•	Quantity: total shirts (≥ 24).
	•	Print details:
	•	Number of locations.
	•	Number of ink colors per location.
	•	Fees:
	•	Per-screen setup cost (per color per location).
	•	Per-print cost per shirt (varies by quantity and colors).
	•	Shipping & handling:
	•	Either baked into margin or added at checkout.

Example Logic (high-level pseudocode)

total_qty = sum(size_quantities)

if total_qty < 24:
    show error

# Garment cost
garment_unit_cost = lookup_garment_cost(garment_id, total_qty)
garment_subtotal = garment_unit_cost * total_qty

# Screen setup fees
screen_count = sum(colors_per_location)  # each color requires a screen
setup_fee_total = screen_count * setup_fee_per_screen

# Print cost per shirt
print_unit_cost = lookup_print_cost(total_qty, colors_per_location, num_locations)
print_subtotal = print_unit_cost * total_qty

# Total project cost
subtotal = garment_subtotal + setup_fee_total + print_subtotal
total = apply_margin_rules(subtotal)  # Optional extra margin/rounding

deposit_due = total * deposit_percentage  # e.g., 0.5

Requirement: All of these tables (garment cost tiers, print cost tiers, setup fees, deposit % config) must be editable in an admin interface—not hardcoded.

6. Tech Stack & Integration Notes

Given you’re already heavily on Shopify, recommended approach:

Option: Custom Shopify App + Theme Section
	•	Front-end:
	•	React/Next or Vanilla JS app embedded in a Shopify theme page via app proxy or custom section.
	•	Uses Shopify Storefront or Ajax APIs for checkout.
	•	Backend:
	•	Node/TypeScript or similar hosted app.
	•	Handles:
	•	Quoting logic
	•	Storing configs
	•	Artwork uploads (S3 or equivalent)
	•	Order config JSON
	•	Checkout:
	•	Create draft order or cart with:
	•	One line item: “Custom Screen Print Order”
	•	Metafield or line item properties storing order configuration.
	•	Partial payment via Shopify’s deposit/partial payment mechanism or a pattern using two linked orders.

Future Integration: Printavo

Long-term, once MVP is working:
	•	Map data fields to Printavo jobs:
	•	Customer info
	•	Garments + quantities
	•	Print locations
	•	Ink colors
	•	Artwork links
	•	Create a “Send to Printavo” button in admin:
	•	Posts order config to Printavo via their API.
	•	Returns job ID stored on order.
	•	This lets your online orders flow straight into your production queue.

⸻

If you’d like, next I can:
	•	Draft the data model (e.g., JSON schema for CustomOrderConfig) so a dev can implement it directly, or
	•	Sketch a page-by-page wireframe description (“above the fold, sidebar, call-to-actions”) for a designer.
